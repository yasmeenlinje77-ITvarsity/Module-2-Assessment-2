                    <h3>MALEFICENT</h3>
                    <p>Cast: Angelina Jolie, Elle Fanning</p>
                       <p>Age: PG13</p>
               </a>
    <p>Maleficent is a kind-hearted fairy, who is deceived by the love of her life, 
          Stefan. Soon, she places a curse on his daughter, Aurora, in order to exact revenge.</p>
     <p>All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long
     trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting
    water and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve 
    as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear 
    flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry 
    their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while 
   Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.</p>
   <p>Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including
    savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
