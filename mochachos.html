For the past 20 years, Mochachos has become a household brand name loved by the most discerning customers. </p>
            </br>
                <p> Thier inspiration came from the demand from the consumer for "exotic" and healthy dining.
They say 'Spicy but Not Hot' and offer a variety of flavours to choose Lemon and Herb, Mild, Hot, Extra Hot and Dynamite.
                Mochachos chicken provides a well-balanced meal that's lower in fat and high in protein, without 
                 compromising on taste. In fact, it's for the taste-experience that Mochachos is most famous! Taste the Fiesta and Enjoy!</p>
